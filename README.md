# Computer Architecture and Organization (cao)

This repository is a collection of [SystemC](https://systemc.org/) implementations and explanations
of hardware components that I wrote while taking a course in Computer Organization/Architecture
at [UFRN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Rio_Grande_do_Norte).
